1- Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
The first one is called at check phase in event loop, and setTimeout is used in timer phase. I use the 
last one to set a time then it will be called. I use setImmediate when i want a callback to be called 
at check phase, after IO.


2- Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
The first one add a function to be executed with high priority over any other queue. 
setImmediate is used to create a callback to be called at check phase, after IO, timer, etc.
